## VineMapper

This is the repo where I aggregate all the data for the posts on [@VineMapper](#social-links).

## Posts
Check [POSTS.md](https://github.com/winstonhoyle/VineMapper/blob/main/POSTS.md) to see what post was uploaded on exact dates.

## Code
Each project has a `requirements.txt` but I have also created a master [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) in root if you want to run multiple projects.
Within each project, this [Code](#Code) section will give you a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to run and create the datasets.
Within each project, is a `README.md` with links to the datasets. I tried to use the datasets raw as they were downloaded but some needed to be altered.
